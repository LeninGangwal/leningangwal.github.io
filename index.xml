      <description>Nov, 2020 I have been in Patna for around 6 months. A lot has happened. But, the initial dissatisfaction of wasting my life here has evaporated away. I put in the effort of getting in touch with my old friends a month ago, and life has been entertaining enough since that. I gave a shot to online dating at the same time and got in touch with a couple of fairly interesting people.</description>

      <description>Why? I went backpacking across Europe all alone for 31 days post my graduation. I had never been abroad, I had barely done any research, I was on a super tight budget, I did not have any accommodation bookings, no itinerary whatsoever, I did not have an international sim card, I did not know anyone, I did not know the languages, I did not what I was going to do for a month, I did not know what lay ahead for me, I did not know anything.</description>
